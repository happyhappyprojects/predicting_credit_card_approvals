### Project Overview

<p>
Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.

<p>
In order to build a reliable machine learning model for pre-determining whether an application should be approved based on the data, build and test at lease 3 machine learning models and pick the best one. Answer the quetion: what is the most important feature in determining whether an application should be approved?</p>

### Data

<p>
The dataset used in this project is the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval">Credit Card Approval</a> dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
</p>
<p>
This file concerns credit card applications.  All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data.
</p>
<p>
This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.  There are also a few missing values.
